## System virtualization
**KVM**(Kernel-based Virtual Machine) is a full virtualization solution built into the Linux kernel. The KVM hypervisor is managed with the *libvirt API* and *virt-manager*/*virsh*. The KVM hypervisor requires either an Interl processor with the Intel VT-x and Intel 64 extensions for x86-based systems, or an AMD processor with the AMD-V and the AMD64 extensions. To verify that the host system hardware suppports the correct extensions, view **/proc/cpuinfo**.
