## LVM
**Logical volumes** and logical volume management make it easier to manage disk space. If a LVM hosted file system needs more space, it can be allocated to its logical volume from the free space in its **volume group** and the file system can be resized. If a disk starts to fail, a replacement disk can be registered as a physical volume with the volume group and the logical volume's extents can be migrated to the new disk.
