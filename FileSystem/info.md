## Confusion
The term filesystem has two somewhat different meanings, both of which are commonly used. This can be confusing to novices, but after a while the meaning is usually clear from the context.

One meaning is the entire hierarchy of directories (also referred to as the directory tree) that is used to organize files on a computer system. On Linux and Unix, the directories start with the root directory (designated by a forward slash), which contains a series of subdirectories, each of which, in turn, contains further subdirectories, etc.

The second meaning is the type of filesystem, that is, how the storage of data (i.e., files, folders, etc.) is organized on a computer disk (hard disk, floppy disk, CDROM, etc.) or on a partition on a hard disk. Each type of filesystem has its own set of rules for controlling the allocation of disk space to files and for associating data about each file (referred to as meta data) with that file, such as its filename, the directory in which it is located, its permissions and its creation date.
