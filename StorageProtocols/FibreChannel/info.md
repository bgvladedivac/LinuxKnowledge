## Description
FC presents block devices similiar to iSCSI. I/O operations are carried out over a netwok, using a block access protocol. In FC, remote bloks are accessed by encapsulating SCSI commands and data into FC frames. FC is commonly deployed in the majority of mission-critical environments. 
## Implementation
Requires a dedicated host bus adapter(HBA)(typically two, for redundancy and multipathing).
