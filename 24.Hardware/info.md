An operating system has to work closely with the hardware system that acts as its foundations. The operating system needs certain services that can only be provided by the hardware.

## The CPU ( Central Processing Unit )
The CPU or the microprocessor is the heart of any computer system. The microprocessor calculates, performs logical operations and *manages data flows by reading instructions from memory and then executing them*. In the early days of computing the functional components of the microprocessor were separate (and physically large) units. This is when the term Central Processing Unit was coined. The modern microprocessor combines these components onto an integrated circuit etched onto a very small piece of silicon. The terms CPU, microprocessor and processor are all used interchangeably.

Microprocessors operate on binary data, which is composed of ones and zeros. Microprocessors can perform arithmetic operations such as add, multiply and divide and logical operations such as  *is A greater than B?*. The processor's execution is governed by an external clock. It generates regular clock pulses to the processor and at each clock pulse the processor does some work. A processor's speed is described in terms of the rate of the system clock ticks. A 100Mhz processor will receive 100,000,000 clock ticks every second. 

A **processor register** is a quickly accessible location available to a computer's central processing unit (CPU). Registers usually consist of a small amount of fast storage. The **Program Counter (PC)** register contains the address of the next instruction to be executed. 

## Controllers and Peripherals
Peripherals are real devices, such as graphics cards or disks controlled by controller chips on the system board or on cards plugged into it. The SCSI disks are controlled by the SCSI disk controller chips and so on. These controllers are connected to the CPU and to each other by a variety of buses. Most systems built now use PCI buses to connect together the main system components. The controllers are processors like the CPU itself, they can be viewed as intelligent helpers to the CPU. The CPU is in overall control of the system.
